## Imp

> contact with a supernatural agency.

### Overview

This is a very small library that exists to scratch one itch.

It provides a zero-cost macro to summon implicit values.

One use of this is the `imp` method, which is similar to `implicitly`
(but without any of the latter's indirection). Previously, there were
cases where context-bound syntax [1] or other indirection was not
optimal due to the cost associated with `implicitly`.

There is a convention when creating type classes in Scala to provide
an `apply` method on the companion object, to access an implicit type
class instance. The `summon` macro can be used here to create a more
efficient form of this method.

### Getting Imp

Imp supports Scala 2.10 and 2.11. If you use SBT, you can include
Sortilege via the following `build.sbt` snippets:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.spire-math" %% "imp" % "0.0.1" % "provided"
```

### Examples

Here's an example which creates a reversed ordering instance:

```scala
import imp.imp

val reversed = imp[Ordering[Int]].reverse
```

Here's a definition of the `Magma` type class which uses `imp.summon`:

```scala
import imp.summon

trait Magma[A] {
  def combine(x: A, y: A): A
}

object Magma  {
  def apply[A: Magma]: Magma[A] = summon[Magma[A]]
  // better than: def apply[A](implicit ev: Magma[A]): Magma[A] = ev

  implicit val IntMagma: Magma[Int] =
    new Magma[Int] { def combine(x: A, y: A): A = x + y }
}

Magma[Int].combine(3, 4)
// equivalent to: Magma.IntMagma.combine(3, 4)
// better than: implicitly[Magma[Int]].combine(3, 4)
```
